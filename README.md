## Overview

SentiFilm is a simple web app that gives you the sentiment of a movie review with a polarity score. I will be adding more features to this application in order to improve performace and give more information regarding the text input. For now, Sentifilm uses a lexical model to compute sentiment of a given text.

## Dataset

The dataset that was used was the [IMDB Movie Review dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

## Dependencies

*Note these dependencies are being used for other sentiment analysis methods that are currently not included in the application however will later be added.*

* Spacy
* Django
* NumPy
* NLTK
* Pandas
* Requests
* Gensim
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Keras
* Afinn
* Scikit Learn
* Beautiful Soup 4
* Skater

## Improvements

These are some additional features I want to add in order to have this web app give more information regarding the text input.

- [_] Implement supervised methods trained on dataset for better performance
- [_] Implement topic modeling and visualization for text input
- [_] Improve UI
